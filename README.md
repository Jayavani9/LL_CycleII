#LinkedList Cycle Implementation(Solution.java)
The Solution.java file contains the solution to the Leetcode problem LinkedListCycle II.
There are two ways mentioned in the solution file.
The code is implemented in Java.
1. Using a HashSet of type ListNode (Time complexity: O(n) and space complexity: O(n)
2. Using two pointers (Slow and fast) (Time complexity: O(n) and space complexity: O(1)

#Linked List Implementation(Node.java)
The solution provides the implementation of the linked list with methods like get(index) addatHead assAtTail AddatIndex...
